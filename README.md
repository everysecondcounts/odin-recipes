# odin-recipes

Hi!

This is my first TOP mini-project, a simple recipes static website in plain HTML.

By doing it, my main objective was to test my working knowledge of basic workflows and make sure I'm able to accomplish the following:
<ul>
    <li>Work from unix CLI to create directories & files</li>
    <li>Create the website structure without relying on the GUI</li> 
    <li>Stage and commit modified files and get used to working with GIT from the terminal</li>
    <li>Write my first commit messages on VSCode</li> 
    <li>Practice working with atomic commits vs non-atomic commits to understand the advantages of the former</li> 
    <li>Push modifications to the repo</li>
    <li>Deploy a live example of the site on GitHub pages</li>
    <li>Set up Referrer-Policy on individual links to increase the site's security and preserve users' privacy</li>
    <li>Increase workflow productivity by getting used to working with Oh My Zsh shortcuts</li> 
    <li>Review all my previously acquired HTML fundamentals by creating this MVP website</li> 
</ul>

TO-DO: style the site and improve upcoming commit messages so they include subject + body. 

Thanks to The Odin Project for the professionalism and high standards of this curriculum.
