# odin-recipes

Hi!

This is my first TOP mini-project, a simple recipes static website in plain HTML.

By doing it, my main objective was to test my working knowledge of basic workflows and make sure I'm able to accomplish the following:
<ul>
    <li>Work from my unix CLI to create directories & files</li>
    <li>Create the website structure without relying on the GUI</li> 
    <li>Stage and commit modified files and familiarize myself with GIT</li>
    <li>Write my first commit messages (to be improved)</li> 
    <li>Set up Referrer-Policy on individual links to increase the site's security and preserve users' privacy</li>
    <li>Increase workflow productivity by getting used to working with Oh My Zsh shortcuts</li> 
    <li>Review all my previously acquired HTML fundamentals by creating this MVP website</li> 
</ul>
Upcoming: style the site and improve commit messages.
